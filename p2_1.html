        <h1>Telepsychiatry</h1>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Telepsychiatry is a branch of telemedicine that involves providing psychiatric services remotely through telecommunications technology. This method enables mental health professionals to offer assessment, diagnosis, therapy, and medication management from a distance, using video conferencing, phone calls, or secure messaging.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Implementation in India</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Telepsychiatry has gained significant traction in India, especially in regions where access to mental health professionals is limited. It has been instrumental in bridging the gap between urban centers with established mental health services and rural or remote areas lacking adequate resources.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In India, several initiatives and platforms have emerged that offer telepsychiatry services. Mental health professionals connect with patients via video consultations, providing assessments, counseling, and prescriptions where necessary. Various mental health organizations, government initiatives, and private practitioners have integrated telepsychiatry into their services to reach a broader population across the country, addressing issues of stigma, accessibility, and affordability. The use of telepsychiatry has also seen a surge during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure continuity of mental health care while adhering to safety protocols.</p>
